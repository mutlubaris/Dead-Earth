M4 Rifle Correct Placement NOTES


For correct placement and animation of the included Rifle, it should be parented/attached to the "RightHandMiddle1" finger bone.

In Maya/Motionbuilder the correct X-Y-Z local translation and rotation is:

T =	-12.24	-1.29	-0.57
R =	-7.83	-13.27	21.10


The 3D program you are using may have a different coordinate system (Z up versus Y up, etc.), and the numbers will be different accordingly.
