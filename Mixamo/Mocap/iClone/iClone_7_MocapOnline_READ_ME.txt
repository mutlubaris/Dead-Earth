NOTES:

Thank You for using iClone Animations from Mocap Online!


Animations are for iClone 7.

----------------

Place the MotusMan Character "MotusMan_v55.iAvatar" in the "Custom" Character folder.
For example:

\Reallusion\Content\Custom\iClone 7 Custom\Character\

----------------

Place the ".rlMotion" files in your "Custom" Motion folder.
For example:

\Reallusion\Content\Custom\iClone 7 Custom\Motion\


PLEASE NOTE: MotusMan_v55.iAvatar is a slightly different skeleton from our iClone 6 animations, so it will have slightly different proportions and not be directly compatible with our previous MotusMan_v2.iAvatar animation files. All versions are of course compatible with any other character in iClone 7.
