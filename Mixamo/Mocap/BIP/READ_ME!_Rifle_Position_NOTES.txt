M4 Rifle Correct Placement NOTES


For correct placement and animation of the included Rifle, it should be parented/attached to the "RightHandMiddle1" finger bone.

In Maya/Motionbuilder the correct X-Y-Z local translation and rotation is:

T =	-12.24	-1.29	-0.57
R =	-7.83	-13.27	21.10


The 3D program you are using may have a different scale and coordinate system (Z up versus Y up, etc.), and the numbers will be different accordingly.

We suggest you use the "Stand_Aim_To_Relaxed" animation as a reference. 

Adjust/tweak the Rifle Trans and Rot at frame zero(the Aim pose) till it is exactly square on all axes facing forward and looks correct in both hands. Then go to the end of the animation(the Relaxed pose) and check it still looks good in both hands. 

When positioned correctly It will be aiming perfectly square with the world at frame zero, and still look good in the hands at the end in the relaxed position.
